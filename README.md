This is my first R dashboard and I did:
* Data Exploration
* Data Cleaning
* Feature Creation
* Plotting graphs using ggplots and plotly .
Using the plots we explored important points related to youtuve video views and the journey of youtube .
I explored relation between years and comments,year and likes ,year and title and likes and comment by keyword.
